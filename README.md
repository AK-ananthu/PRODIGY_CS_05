# PRODIGY_CS_05
# Task 05: Network Sniffer Tool

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship. The goal is to develop a packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network packets and displays key information.

##Features

- Captures live packets from the network
- Displays:
  - Source and destination IP addresses
  - Protocol type (TCP/UDP)
  - Port numbers
  - Packet payload (if available)
- Lightweight and fast using `scapy`

# Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Scapy** (for packet capturing and parsing)

# How to Run

# 1. Install dependencies:
bash
pip install scapy

# Run the script 
 sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
